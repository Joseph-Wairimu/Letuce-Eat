This project aim at designing a restaurants website to enable fast services for customers.
####Design
My design practice offers a full range of services including, interaction and visual design and user experience testing. Throughout my project, I create and implement visual design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work to make sure what gets built is what is needed.

####Product Management
Planning and development is iterative. Because I am constantly coding and testing, the product I build is always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.
